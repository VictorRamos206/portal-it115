       <p>
        Victor Ramos is currently a workforce professional in a program called Year Up studying Software Development at
        Seattle Central College with aspirations to become a QA Analyst. Victor is also a head coach for multiple non 
        profits in the Seattle area. When he decided to get into coaching vs. playing, he wanted to teach players what 
        he didn't get growing up as a player - development of game IQ and tactical understanding. Victor has been 
        coaching Atletico's B07 group (now U15) since they were U10's. Although he is proud of the many state 
        championship and tournament trophies, he is most proud of all the players who have developed as human 
        beings. Many kids have improved their grades dramatically, 
        learned to be on time and many have gone on to play Sounders and FC Dallas academy.
